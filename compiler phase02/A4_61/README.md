How to execute :
    just run make after changing the directory to A4_61

If you want debug trace, set yydebug = 1 in line no 5 in backup.c

What will be generated as output:
    In terminal : debug trace will be printed if debug is enabled
    In output.txt : productions and corresponding line number will be printed

Changes made in grammar:
  -> As only a single postfix op is allowed in an expression so productions are changed as follows
     postfix_expression:
					primary_expression | IDENTIFIER '[' expression ']' | IDENTIFIER '(' argument_expression_list_optional ')' | IDENTIFIER ARROW IDENTIFIER;
